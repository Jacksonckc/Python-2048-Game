The game that I will be creating is called 2048, 2048 game has a goal of getting up to number 2048. 
The game will randomly generate number 2 or 4 at random positions on the board. 
The game receives 1 input at a time, w/s/a/d, all the numbers will shift to the input direction accordingly.
If the adjacent numbers are equal, those 2 numbers will add up into one. 
Play till the player has number 2048
The game will end at 2048 or when there is no changes could be made.
